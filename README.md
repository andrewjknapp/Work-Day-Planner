# Workday-Planner

## Purpose
- I created this hourly planner to keep track of my daily tasks. 

## How to Use
- Enter text into whichever hourblock is needed and then save. The text is stored in local storage and will persist until this local storage is emptied. 
- The colors correspond to the current hour of the day. Any hours that have passed are colored gray, the current hour is red, and upcomming hours are colored green. 
 
## Documentation
- displayDate() uses display week, day, and month to format the current date.
- renderHours() takes in hours the start time and end time for the planner. This loops through, determines the color and formats text for each hour block. Each block is then displayed on the screen.
- verifyHours() Ensures that the start hour is smaller than the stop hour and that both are within 1 and 24. This will be used in a future update in which the user can choose which hours to display.
